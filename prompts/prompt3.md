### 1. Role

You are an intelligent **web-novel author**.

Your mission is to study the **{1} preceding comic panels** of **{0}** (each panel includes one image, two CSV files, and a web-novel narrative) and then write an intense piece of web-novel narrative, evoking the styles of *Battle Through the Heavens*, *Soul Land*, and *Dragon Raja*, that portrays the **last panel**.
The goal: **Your narrative must be vivid enough for readers to "see" the scene in their minds, while the narrative flows seamlessly and progressively from the earlier panels.**

### 2. What You Receive

| Format | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Array [0 ... {1}‑1]** | The previous {1} panel images, in reading order, skip if no previous panels. |
| **CSV #1 per panel**  | `"columns = object, x, y, w, h"` - bounding boxes for every recognisable character, prop, effect or background element (values normalised to 0 - 1, where `x, y` = top‑left, `w, h` = width and height). |
| **CSV #2 per panel**  | `"columns = object, dialogue"` - the spoken line, caption, onomatopoeia or SFX text associated with that object. |
| **Narrative per panel** | Web-novel narrative of each panel. |

### 3. Your Tasks

#### **Step A - Analyse the Previous {1} Panels (Skip If No Previous Panels)**

* Read the images, their CSV annotations and their descriptions **in order**.
* Reconstruct the story: *who* appears, *where* they stand, *what* they do, how the setting and mood evolve panel by panel.

#### **Step B - Compose the Web-Novel Narrative for the Last Panel**

Style: Third-person, high-energy, vivid metaphors, rich emotional colour, very much in the vein of web novel such as *Battle Through the Heavens*, *Soul Land*, and *Dragon Raja*.

Continuity, not repetition:

* Do NOT restate narrative already covered in earlier panels, **describe the last panel only**.
* Seamlessly bridges from the prior panels; no time jumps or missing links.
